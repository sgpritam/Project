How to connect create a Python Virtual Environment
It is often useful to have one or more Python environments where you can experiment with different combinations of packages without affecting your main installation. Python supports this through virtual environments. The virtual environment is a copy of an existing version of Python with the option to inherit existing packages. A virtual environment is also useful when you need to work on a shared system and do not have permission to install packages as you will be able to install them in the virtual environment.

Outline
Open a terminal
Setup the pip package manager
Install the virtualenv package
Create the virtual environment
Activate the virtual environment
Deactivate the virtual environment
Optional: Make the virtual environment your default Python

Open a terminal
The method you use to open a terminal depends on your operating system.

Windows
Open the Windows Command Prompt (show path via Start menu and keyboard shortcuts)

Mac OS / Linux
Open the Terminal program. This is usually found under Utilities or Accessories.

Setup the pip package manager
Check to see if your Python installation has pip. Enter the following in your terminal:

pip -h
If you see the help text for pip then you have pip installed, otherwise download and install pip

Install the virtualenv package
The virtualenv package is required to create virtual environments. You can install it with pip:

pip install virtualenv
Create the virtual environment
To create a virtual environment, you must specify a path. For example to create one in the local directory called ‘mypython’, type the following:

virtualenv mypython
Activate the virtual environment
You can activate the python environment by running the following command:

Mac OS / Linux
source mypython/bin/activate
Windows
mypthon\Scripts\activate
You should see the name of your virtual environment in brackets on your terminal line e.g. (mypython).

Any python commands you use will now work with your virtual environment

Deactivate the virtual environment
To decativate the virtual environment and use your original Python environment, simply type ‘deactivate’.

deactivate
Optional: Make the virtual environment your default Python
